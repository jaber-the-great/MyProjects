* I designed this system for my TA class
* Students were supposed to implement a client which sends their student number to the server
* The server is multi threaded and can handle simultaneous connections
* The servers read the student number from a file (list.txt) and retrieves the name of the student from that file
* Then the server writes the name and student number of that student into the "registered.txt" file
