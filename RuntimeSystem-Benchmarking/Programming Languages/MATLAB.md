## MATLAB
#### General 
* Loosely and weakly typed as well as dynamically typed 
  * Can cause problem when re-using or changing the code
* It's a scripted rather than compiled language
* It uses an interpreter
* MATLAB code is interpreted and optimized by JIT accelerator 
  * Removes redundant code
  * Re-orders the commands
* MATLAB performs extra operations such as checking that what is passed to functions is appropriate, sometimes performing some analysis to determine the best internal method for accomplishing the operation. That is one of the reasons that it is slower than some other languages

#### Compiler as extra toolbox for sharing:
* [MATLAB Compiler](https://www.mathworks.com/help/compiler/index.html)
* Compiler allows you to share the code without the need of buying MATLAB for destination:
  * Standalone application
  * Webapp
  * Docker image
  * Hadoop/spark
  * Excel add-in
#### Runtime:
* Required to run artifacts generated by MATLAB complier
