* performance comparison between MATLAB, R, and Python, all three interpreted languages, when evaluating programs having to do with data science.
* All three languages are used for data analysis, so their performance comparison will show where each language excels and where each one struggles. 
* For evaluation, we plan on using five programs from this website. We also plan on writing five additional programs that will emphasize data analysis task as their content.
