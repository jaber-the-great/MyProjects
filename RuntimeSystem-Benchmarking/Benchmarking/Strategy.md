## Benchmarking strategy:
1. Running all of the codes on the same device (same hardware resources)
2. Making sure there is no heavy background process is running on the computer during the execution of benchmarks 
3. Running each code 10 times and taking the average, max and min 
4. Running the benchmark couple of times in different times of the day to get more accurate data
5. Running all of the codes simultaniously to see which one would be the winner
   1. Considering which programming lang can get the resources faster and run faster
   2. Compare two by two: eg Java vs Python , Java vs R 
6. Compare the benchmark of already compiled codes with the interpreted ones
