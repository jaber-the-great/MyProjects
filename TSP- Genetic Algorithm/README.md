## Traveling Sales Person(TSP) problem solved by artificial intelligence (genetic algorithm)
* My code was the fastest one in the class based on the TA observation and feedback
#### Input format:
1. Name if input is "infile"
2. First line: The population size
3. Second line: Chromosome length (number of cities)
4. Third line: Number of generations
5. Forth line: Probability of crossover
6. Fifth line: Probability of mutation
7. Sixth line: Name of output file
8. Rest of the file: The adjacency matrix, each element is the distance between two cities (zero as infinity or no direct link) 
#### Output format:
1. Name is provided in "infile"
2. Current generation number
3. Size of the best fitness in current generation
4. Number of generation with highest fitness so far
5. Maximum fitness so far
6. The final result is the chromosome with the highest fitness
